## Introduction

Greetings! I extend warm wishes of peace to you with the universal greetings of Assalamualaikum, Shalom, Om Swastiastu, Namo Buddhaya, and Salam kebajikan. Allow me to present myself through this web exercise, where the content is dedicated to sharing information about me. The goal is to contribute knowledge and experiences to the visitors, aspiring to inspire each one of you. This venture marks my initial foray into web development, encompassing both personal practice and academic assignments. As seen, CSS has not been incorporated yet, and the website relies solely on HTML at this stage. I am eager to advance in crafting websites that not only function effectively but also radiate professionalism.
